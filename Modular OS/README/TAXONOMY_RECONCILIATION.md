# CP Module Taxonomy Reconciliation
Version: 1.0 | Created: 2026-06-08
Resolves: Audit F-2 (conflicting module taxonomies)
Status: **RESOLVED 2026-06-08; FULLY APPLIED 2026-06-20.** Owner ratified Taxonomy A (v2 Canonical). The email matrix, common preamble, CP-X route graph, CP-X example output, onboarding guide, and CP-1A schema were re-synced to that taxonomy. The current consistency check reports 26 modules with 0 drift across schema, active prompts, CP-X routing, and onboarding. The recommendation and mapping below remain as an audit record.

## 1. The conflict

Two different module taxonomies coexist in the v2 corpus and disagree on what several CP-IDs *are*:

- **Taxonomy A — v2 Canonical** (used by `MODULES_REFERENCE_v2.md`, `SYSTEM_ROUTE_MAP_v2.md`, `MODULE_EXECUTION_ORDER_v2.md`, and the 22 files in `KNOWLEDGE SOURCES/02_SCHEMA/MODULE_PAYLOADS/`). All dated v2.0 / 2026-06-08.
- **Taxonomy B — Legacy** (embedded in `KNOWLEDGE SOURCES/00_GOVERNANCE/CP-COMMON_PREAMBLE.md` `module_manifest` and in all 24 copies of `REF_CP-EMAIL_SourceRoutingMatrix.md`).

Because `REF_CP-EMAIL` is referenced by **every** module, its labels determine where email-derived intelligence is routed. Under Taxonomy A numbering, those routes point at the **wrong modules**.

## 2. Point-by-point disagreement

| CP-ID | Taxonomy A — v2 Canonical (authoritative) | Taxonomy B — Legacy (in REF_CP-EMAIL / preamble) | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| CP-2 | FundamentalCreditSynthesizer | "Earnings & Cash Flow" | Label drift (same lane) |
| CP-2D | GovernanceSponsorScore | "Downside Scenario" | **Wrong lane** (downside = CP-2B in A) |
| CP-2E | LiquidityCashFlowBridge | "EBITDA Quality / Addback Review" | **Wrong lane** |
| CP-3 | RelativeValueSecuritySelection | "Capital Structure" | **Wrong lane** |
| CP-3C | PortfolioFitPositionSizing | "Maturity Profile" | **Wrong lane** |
| CP-3D | RefinancingLMERisk | "Debt Dynamics / Refinancing & LME" | Aligned (label only) |
| CP-4 | LegalCovenantInterpreter | "Covenant Analysis" | Aligned (label only) |
| CP-5 | ResearchIntegrityQA | "Relative Value" | **Wrong lane** |
| CP-5B | EvidenceTraceValidator | "Market Context" | **Wrong lane** |
| CP-6A | ICDebateChallenge | "Legal / Structural" | **Wrong lane** |

CP-0, CP-1, CP-1A, CP-X, CP-6E are consistent across both.

## 3. Recommendation — adopt Taxonomy A (v2 Canonical) as authoritative

Rationale:
1. **Corroboration.** Taxonomy A is asserted independently by three v2.0 artifacts (modules reference, route map, execution order) **and** hard-coded as `const` values in the 22 payload schemas (e.g. `CP-3.module_name = "RelativeValueSecuritySelection"`, `CP-5.module_name = "ResearchIntegrityQA"`). Taxonomy B appears only in two cross-cutting files that were not re-synced to v2.
2. **Internal consistency.** The route map's dependency edges (e.g. CP-5B→CP-5 as the QA loop; CP-3→CP-3B/3C; CP-6A convergence on 11 analytical feeds) only make sense under Taxonomy A.
3. **Schema enforcement.** The payload-schema `const module_name` values will *reject* any output using Taxonomy B names, so A is already the enforced contract.

**Therefore:** `REF_CP-EMAIL` and `CP-COMMON_PREAMBLE.module_manifest` carry stale labels and must be re-synced to Taxonomy A.

## 4. Corrected email-routing intent (Taxonomy A)

The *semantics* of each email matrix section should be re-pointed to the correct v2 module. Key corrections:

| REF_CP-EMAIL section (current) | Should govern (v2 module) | Note |
|---|---|---|
| §4.5 "CP-2E EBITDA Quality" | **CP-2E LiquidityCashFlowBridge** | EBITDA-quality guidance belongs under CP-2/CP-1; liquidity email rules belong here |
| §4.6 "CP-3 Capital Structure" | **CP-3 RelativeValueSecuritySelection** | Capital-structure email rules belong under CP-1/CP-1A; RV/pricing email rules belong here |
| §4.7 "CP-3C Maturity Profile" | **CP-3C PortfolioFitPositionSizing** | Maturity-wall email rules belong under CP-3D |
| §4.11 "CP-5 Relative Value" | **CP-5 ResearchIntegrityQA** | RV email rules belong under CP-3; CP-5 is QA (mostly Context/Trigger, not Evidence) |
| §4.12 "CP-5B Market Context" | **CP-5B EvidenceTraceValidator** | Market-context email rules belong under CP-3; CP-5B validates lineage |

**Implication:** this is not a find-replace of labels — several sections' *content* (allowed Evidence/Context/Trigger rules) was written for the legacy lane and must be re-authored for the correct v2 lane. The "Relative Value" email rules, for instance, are analytically correct but currently attached to CP-5 (QA) — they should move to CP-3.

## 5. Corrective actions completed

1. Rewrote `CP-COMMON_PREAMBLE.md` `module_manifest` to Taxonomy A, including L7 and infrastructure modules, and resolved the former `Feeds: TBD` placeholders.
2. Re-authored the canonical `REF_CP-EMAIL_SourceRoutingMatrix.md` and re-synced its module copies to Taxonomy A.
3. Re-synced the CP-X route graph, example output pattern, and onboarding documentation.
4. Added the module consistency check that compares schema, active prompt, CP-X route, and onboarding names.

## 6. Validation

Run this from the repository root:

```bash
python3 "Modular OS/tools/check_module_consistency.py"
```

The expected result is `26 modules checked, 0 with drift`.

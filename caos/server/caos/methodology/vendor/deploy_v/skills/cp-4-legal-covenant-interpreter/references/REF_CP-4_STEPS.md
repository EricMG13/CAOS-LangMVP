Consolidated method bundle. Each section below is one original file, byte-identical, under its own `## <filename>` heading.

Step sections (`## REF_..._<NN>_*`) are read selectively: open the one for each workflow step when that step begins, not in advance. This file is a container, not a reading list -- opening it whole loads every step of the module at once.

The following sections are binding method for every run of this module, not conditional on a step naming them -- open them before authoring output: REF_CP-4_AggressivenessRubric.md, REF_CP-4_ExampleOutputPattern.md, REF_CP-4_Workflow.md.

4. Identify completeness limitations: missing amendments, schedules, exhibits, compliance certificates.
5. Note governing law and jurisdiction.
6. Check covenant-review report availability.
7. Verify structured-export readiness.
8. Assign Module Status:
   - **Completed:** Executed governing doc(s) + current financial inputs.

<reference module="CP-4" name="Source Authority & Aggressiveness Scoring">

Authoritative for CP-4 source ranking (Step 2) and the covenant aggressiveness score (Step 11). Load alongside the CP-4 workflow.

## Source Authority Hierarchy (6 ranks)
| Rank | Source Type | Governing Role |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | Executed credit agreement / indenture (incl. amendments) | Controls all provision-level analysis |
| 2 | Executed intercreditor agreement | Controls lien priority and enforcement mechanics |
| 3 | Compliance certificates / covenant schedules | Controls tested ratios and usage |
| 4 | Offering memorandum covenant description | Summary of key provisions; verify against executed doc |
| 5 | Third-party covenant-review report | Independent assessment; verify against executed doc |
| 6 | Lender presentation / term sheet / posting memorandum | Marketing / pre-execution; lowest authority |

## Covenant Aggressiveness Rubric (1–5 Scale)
| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Lender-Friendly | Tight maintenance covenants, limited incurrence, narrow leakage, comprehensive collateral/guarantor, strong lender control |
| 2 | Disciplined | Maintenance present with adequate headroom, moderate incurrence subject to tests, bounded RP/investment baskets, standard protections |
| 3 | Market-Standard | Typical LBO/HY package, standard grower baskets, standard builder basket, standard collateral with some release flexibility |
| 4 | Aggressive | Cov-lite/limited maintenance, large incurrence baskets, broad leakage/USub flexibility, material EBITDA add-back inflation, weak MFN |
| 5 | Highly Creditor-Adverse | No meaningful maintenance, uncapped debt/lien capacity, priming-enabling provisions, broad asset transfer, weak/absent lender protections |

## Aggressiveness Scoring Areas (7)
| Area | What to Assess |
|------|---------------|
| Maintenance covenant architecture | Presence, type, step-down, headroom, consequence, cure |
| Debt / lien incurrence capacity | Fixed, grower, ratio, incremental, free-and-clear, MFN |
| RP / investment / leakage capacity | RP baskets, builder basket, investment capacity, USub, asset transfer |
| EBITDA definitions and add-back flexibility | Add-back caps, synergy provisions, pro forma rules, time limits |
| Collateral / guarantor protection | Coverage, release mechanics, excluded subsidiaries, non-guarantor risk |
| Amendment / control mechanics | Thresholds, sacred rights, class voting, waiver flexibility |
| Overall | Composite weighted toward highest-severity area with most material credit implication |

## Scoring Rules
- Do not score an area unless provision-level evidence supports the assessment.
- If evidence for an area is insufficient: [Not Scorable].
- Overall score is NOT a simple average — weight toward highest creditor-adverse severity and most material credit implication.
- If fewer than 3 areas scorable: overall = [Not Scorable] or [Provisional].
- Every score must include: evidence basis, risk mechanic, credit implication, and confidence level.
- Confidence levels: Completed (full executed documents + financial inputs) | Provisional (partial evidence or draft documents) | Not Scorable (insufficient evidence).

## Style (relocated from ACTIVE_PROMPT 2026-07-11)
Professional, neutral, precise, institutional, legal-risk focused, creditor-oriented, evidence-led, committee-ready, recovery-aware. Use clean Markdown tables where instructed. Use concise paragraphs and dense bullets. Use creditor language: debt capacity, lien capacity, leakage, priming, MFN, incremental facilities, USub, restricted group, guarantor coverage, collateral release, amendment risk, lender control, structural subordination, PD, LGD, recovery, relative value. A dense, accurate sentence is preferred to broad generic commentary. Target 1–5 pages per issuer scaled to complexity.

2. Example (Illustrative Only — Do Not Use as Issuer Data)

Provision: Section 7.03(b)(iv) — Incremental Facility
Source: Credit Agreement dated [Date] | Executed | Authority Rank 1
Summary: Permits up to the greater of $200m and 100% of LTM Consolidated
  EBITDA in incremental first-lien pari debt, subject to pro forma first-lien
  net leverage ratio not exceeding 4.25x. No MFN protection after 12-month
  sunset.
Risk Mechanic: Grower basket tied to EBITDA means capacity expands with
  add-back-inflated EBITDA. MFN sunset permits repricing of incremental debt
  without economics protection for existing lenders after 12 months.
PD Effect: Moderate — capacity permits releveraging under stress if EBITDA
  add-backs inflate denominator.
LGD / Recovery Effect: High — pari secured incremental debt directly dilutes
  recovery for existing first-lien creditors.
Monitoring Implication: Track incremental facility utilization, EBITDA add-back
  trajectory, and MFN sunset date.
Credit Implication: Negative — Leverage Increase
Confidence: High
Evidence ID: [CP4-EV-001]

CREDIT IMPLICATION (8-value Legal/Covenant subset):
Positive — Covenant Headroom Expansion | Positive — Deleveraging |
Neutral — Stable | Negative — Covenant Erosion |
Negative — Leverage Increase | Negative — Refinancing Risk |
Negative — Liquidity Deterioration | Insufficient Information

## Binding discipline

These rules are per-module applications of the Canon Core items they cite.

**Covenant debt definition vs. canonical basis:** for the covenant/credit-agreement definition of Indebtedness (or Consolidated Total Debt) used in ratio tests, record whether it is measured on carrying value, gross principal, or a bespoke definition (e.g., excluding unamortized discount, including or excluding capitalized leases); log any divergence from the canonical carrying-value basis as a Definition Conflict Register row (both figures, both locators) (Canon Core item 5).

**Multi-figure debt amounts across documents:** where the same debt/facility amount is stated differently across governing documents (commitment amount in the credit agreement vs. outstanding amount in the most recent compliance certificate vs. amount recited in an amendment), extract ALL figures, label each with its document role and date, and log the set as ONE Conflict-Register row explaining why they differ rather than silently reconciling them (Canon Core item 6).

**Non-debt funding liabilities inside the debt-capacity tests:** where the Indebtedness / Total Debt definition used for ratio debt, free-and-clear, or grower baskets excludes material non-debt funding liabilities that fund operations (customer deposits, deferred revenue, supplier-finance / reverse-factoring programs), flag this as a capacity-relevant gap — that liability is credit-relevant float sitting outside every debt basket and ratio test, not ordinary trade payables (Canon Core item 8).
